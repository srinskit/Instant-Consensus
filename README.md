# Instant Consensus
# Leader selection
1.  The winner is selected based on the minimum distance between the userâ€™s address and the previous block hash in the blockchain.
2.  Since everyone has the address of all nodes, the winner can be found out by everyone, and hence there is no need for broadcasting to come to a consensus on the winner.
